# Convolutional Deep Learning Model to Classify Dogs from Cats
## I. What is this?
- This is mainly an experimental project I did as a recap of my Deep Learning class through this semester. It is very simple and the code is not clean at all. But it works.
- Included in this repository is a pretrained model with around 80% accuracy.
- The train data is wiped because it is about a gigabyte and my laptop just will not upload it.
## II. Where do you get the data then?
- You can get the data from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). Extract it into data if you want to train your own (or retrain) the models.
