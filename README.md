# Convolutional Deep Learning Model to Classify Dogs from Cats
## I. What is this?
- This is mainly an experimental project I did as a recap of my Deep Learning class through this semester. It is very simple and the code is not clean at all. But it works.
- Included in this repository is a pretrained model with around 80% accuracy.
- The train data is wiped because it is about a gigabyte and my laptop just will not upload it.
## II. Where do you get the data then?
- You can get the data from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). Extract it into a folder called data (create one if it doesn't exist) if you want to train your own (or retrain) the models.
## III. If you want to test the model
- Create a subfolder within the data folder (create if non-existent) and put your image in there. Then simply load the load_model.py file to run the pre-trained model. Likewise you can change the the implementation in order to load any other model as well.
